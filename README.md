# Algorithm Solutions

This repository contains different algorithm questions and solutions from hackerank, leetcode and some of Vanhack code test.
To run the algorithms, use the following steps as all will be through the laravels ````php artisan command````

The following step will be taken to run the different algorithm classes in the repo.

1. Clone the repository
2.  Run ````composer install````
3. Run ```php artisan``` to see all the artisan commands
4. Pick the one that suites the algorithm topic you wanna run. The artisan commands is formed with the topic of the algorithm test.

1. ````php artisan media-of-two-sorted-arrays:run````
2. supply the numbers as requested
3. Wait for the calculated median

#Reverse Integer

1. ````php artisan reverse-integer:run````
2. Supply the integer to be reversed
3. Wait for the expected result/output

#Integer to Roman
